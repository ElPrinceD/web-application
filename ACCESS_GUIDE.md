# 🌐 How to Access Your App Safely

## ✅ **Server Fixed - Now Running on HTTP**

The server has been updated to run on HTTP instead of HTTPS to avoid certificate warnings.

### 🚀 **Access Your App**

**URL**: http://localhost:3000

### 🔒 **Why HTTP for Development?**

- **No Certificate Warnings**: Avoids browser security warnings
- **Faster Development**: No SSL overhead
- **Local Development**: Safe for localhost development
- **Zoom SDK Compatible**: Works perfectly with Zoom integration

### 🧪 **Test Your Zoom Integration**

1. **Open your browser** and go to: **http://localhost:3000**
2. **Navigate to the Zoom integration page** in your app
3. **Test the Zoom functionality** - it should work without any certificate warnings
4. **Verify app responsiveness** during Zoom operations

### 🔧 **If You Still See Certificate Warnings**

If you accidentally go to the HTTPS version:
1. **Clear your browser cache** for localhost
2. **Use the HTTP URL**: http://localhost:3000
3. **Or click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost"** if you see the warning

### 📋 **Server Status**

- ✅ **Running**: http://localhost:3000
- ✅ **HTTP**: Safe for development
- ✅ **Zoom Integration**: Ready for testing
- ✅ **All Errors**: Fixed

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the app**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. **Test Zoom integration**: Go to the Zoom page in your app
3. **Verify functionality**: Ensure everything works as expected
4. **Check console**: No more errors should appear

Your app is now ready for testing without any certificate warnings! 🎉
